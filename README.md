# Welcome to My First Contribution!

This project is designed to help you make your very first open-source contribution and earn the **"Open Sourcerer" (🪙)** achievement!

We want to make it easy for beginners to take their first step into the world of open source.

## How to Contribute

It's simple! You just need to add a file with your name to our `contributors` list.

**Here are the 4 steps:**

1.  **Click the "Add Your Name" button below.** This will automatically set up a "fork" (a copy) of this project for you and open the correct folder.
2.  In the "file name" box, type `YOUR_USERNAME.md` (e.g., `dharmanan.md`).
3.  In the large text box, write a simple message like: `Hi, I'm [Your Name] from [Your Country]!`
4.  Click **"Propose new file"**, then **"Create pull request"** on the next page. *Don't change anything, just click the green buttons.*

That's it! I will review and merge your pull request. After it's merged, you will have made your first contribution!
