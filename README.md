# Welcome to My First Contribution!

This project is designed to help you make your very first open-source contribution and earn the **"Open Sourcerer" (🪙)** achievement!

I will guide you through two simple "Pull Requests" (PRs).

---

## Task 1: Add Your Name (Your First PR)

Your first task is to add your name to our `contributors` list.

**Step-by-step guide:**

1.  **Click the "Task 1" button below** - This will take you to GitHub where you can create a new file in the `contributors` folder (you won't need to clone or set up anything!).

2.  **In the "Name your file" box**, replace `YOUR_USERNAME.md` with your GitHub username followed by `.md` 
    - Example: If your username is `john_doe`, type `john_doe.md`
    - If your username is `dharmanan`, type `dharmanan.md`

3.  **In the large text area**, write a simple introduction about yourself
    - Example: `Hi, I'm John Doe from Canada!`
    - Or: `Hi, I'm Sarah from the United States!`
    - Feel free to add your location, interests, or anything you'd like to share!

4.  **Scroll down and click "Propose new file"**, then on the next page click **"Create pull request"**
    - Don't change anything else - just click the green buttons!

5.  **Wait for me to review and merge your pull request**
    - I'll check your contribution and merge it into the main project
    - This usually takes a few hours, but I'll get to it as soon as I can
    - Once merged, your name and avatar will automatically appear on this page!

👇 **Click This Button for Task 1** 👇

## Task 2 (Bonus): Add Your Profile (Your Second PR)

After your first PR is merged, you can try a second one! This time, you'll add your GitHub profile link to the `profiles` list. This is a great way to learn how to make multiple contributions to the same project!

**Step-by-step guide:**

1.  **Wait for your Task 1 PR to be merged first** - Once I merge your first contribution, you'll see your name appear on this page. Then you can start Task 2!

2.  **Click the "Task 2" button below** - Just like Task 1, this will open GitHub's file creation page for the `profiles` folder.

3.  **Name the file `YOUR_USERNAME.md`** - Use the same username as before
    - Example: If you used `john_doe.md` in Task 1, use `john_doe.md` here too
    - It's okay to use the same filename because it's in a different folder (`profiles` instead of `contributors`)

4.  **In the text area**, write your GitHub profile link
    - Example: `My GitHub profile: https://github.com/john_doe`
    - Replace `john_doe` with your actual GitHub username

5.  **Click "Propose new file", then "Create pull request"** - Again, just click the green buttons!

6.  **Wait for me to merge this PR too** - Once merged, your GitHub profile will be linked in the project!

I successfully made my first open-source contribution and earned the **"Open Sourcerer" (🪙)** achievement!

### How I Did It

I contributed to [dharmanan's my-first-contribution project](https://github.com/dharmanan/my-first-contribution) by:

1. **Adding my name** to the contributors list
2. **Creating a pull request** (my first ever!)
3. **Getting it merged** by the project maintainer

### My Achievement Badge
